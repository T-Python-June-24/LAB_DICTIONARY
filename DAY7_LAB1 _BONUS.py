# ### Exercise: Weather Data Aggregation

# **Objective:** Write a Python program that aggregates weather data for different cities and provides weather data based on user queries.

# #### Requirements:

# 1. **Input Weather Data:** Allow the user to input weather data for different cities. Each entry should include the city name, date, temperature, humidity, and weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy).
# 2. **Store Data in a Dictionary:** Use a nested dictionary to store the weather data. The outer dictionary's keys will be the city names, and the values will be another dictionary containing date and weather details.
# 3. **Query by City:** Allow the user to query the weather data by city name, displaying all the recorded weather data for that city.

# #### Guidelines:

# - Use nested dictionaries to store the weather data efficiently.
# - Implement separate functions for inputting data, querying by city.
# - Validate user inputs to ensure correctness.

# #### Challenge:

# - Extend the program to allow the user to update or delete weather data for a specific city and date.
